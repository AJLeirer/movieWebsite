Project: Movie Trailer Website  - [Travis (Aden) Leirer]
================================

The Movie Trailer Website is a very simple project written in Python 2.7.1. A short list of movies and related information are displayed in a web page. 


Required Libraries and Dependencies
-----------------------------------
- Internet connection
- Web browser (preferably Google Chrome)
- Python v2.7.1 


How to Run Project
------------------
Note: Before you can run this project you will need to clone the files from Github to your local repository. 

To run project: 
1. Open a terminal window on your system. 
2. Navigate to the local project directory.
3. At the command prompt, type "entertainment_center.py" and click enter. 


Extra Credit Description
------------------------
I included the storyline in the webpage. 

For this, I wrote a storyline for each movie, passed the movie_storyline strings to the create_movie_tiles_content function in fresh_tomatoes.py, then included an "h3" tag in the HTML to style the content. 


Miscellaneous
-------------
Note: Originally, I intended to use the IMDB API to pull this information, but I spent too much time trying to figure out how to make the API work correctly. I figured I would just keep the project simple and that APIs would be covered in detail during another class in the program.
